## Application of Knowledge Graphs and AI in Risk Assessment - Practical Session

In this presentation, I explore the application of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in safety risk assessment. The content covers how KGs enable the integration of diverse data sources, ensure accessibility and interoperability, and enhance real-time risk assessment and monitoring. Additionally, I demonstrate how fine-tuned AI models, such as GPTs, can support decision-making through predictive insights, handling uncertainty, and scaling large-scale risk evaluations. The final section addresses the benefits, constraints, regulatory considerations, and the importance of a quality and compliance framework for AI and KGs in risk assessment.
